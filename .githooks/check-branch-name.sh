Work happens on a branch and reaches $branch as a merge:

    git switch -c feature/what-you-are-doing

If you have already made changes here, take them with you — the command above keeps them.

    <type>/<description>    types: $(echo "$types" | tr '|' ' ')

The description is lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens — no spaces, underscores, capitals,
double hyphens or a trailing one. For example:

    feature/publish-packs-globally
    bugfix/issue-42-cooldown-off-by-one
    chore/bump-twitchio

    git branch -m <new-name>    renames the branch you are on
