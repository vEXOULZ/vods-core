# Which branch may open a pull request into which. CI runs it for every pull request:
#
#     .conventions/githooks/check-pr-branches.sh <head> <base>
#
# The release flow is set per repo in .conventions.toml:
#
#   flow = "trunk"   Work merges straight into main. Any Conventional Branch may target anything.
#   flow = "dev"     Work integrates on dev, and main is what production runs. So:
#                      - into main:  only dev (a release), release/* or hotfix/*
#                      - into dev:   any Conventional Branch, or main itself (bringing a hotfix back)
#                      - elsewhere:  any Conventional Branch (a PR stacked on another one)
#
# Synced from vEXOULZ/conventions: change it there, not here.

'$head' can't merge into main.

main is what production runs, and it only takes a release (dev), a release/* branch or a hotfix/*.
Point this pull request at dev instead:

    gh pr edit --base dev
